This application is based on laboratory exercises from the course/subject "Web Programming" but has been significantly extended to include additional features and enhancements.

# Overview

The project simulates a cinema management system, allowing users to:
 -  Read, create, update, delete, and filter movies.
 -  Purchase tickets for movies.

While the initial concept is not my original idea, this implementation showcases expanded functionality and advanced use of Spring Boot.

# Technologies Used
- Spring Boot: For building the backend application.
- Spring Security: To manage user authentication and access control.
- Thymeleaf: As the templating engine for dynamic web pages.
- Bootstrap: To design a responsive and user-friendly interface.

Feel free to explore the code and provide any feedback!
