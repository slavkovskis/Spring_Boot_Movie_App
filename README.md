The project/app is made from the laboratory exercises from the course Web Programming, but it is fairly extended.

The idea behind the project is not mine.

Main premise of the project/app is a cinema where you can view, delete, edit, add, filter Movies and also buy tickets.


Used software:
 - Spring Boot
 - Spring Security
 - Bootstrap
 - Thymeleaf
